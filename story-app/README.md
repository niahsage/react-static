React Static Story Page

This project is a simple React application that displays a static story page using reusable components.
The story chosen for this project is Alice in Wonderland, presented with a surreal and minimalist design style.

The purpose of this project is to practice basic React concepts such as creating components, organizing files, importing components into App.js, and running a React app locally using Git and GitHub.

Project Overview

The app is made up of three main components:

Header – Displays the title of the story

Content – Contains a 2–3 paragraph summary of the story

Footer – Displays the moral or lesson of the story

All components are stored in a components folder and are rendered inside the main App component.
